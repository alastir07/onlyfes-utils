To access and view the archives:

1) Download DiscordChatExporter-frontend https://github.com/slatinsky/DiscordChatExporter-frontend/releases (only available on Windows)
2) Extract the downloaded .zip file
3) Download the Archive you wish to view. Aside from the 2025-08-30-Archive, each archive only contains archived channels from the preceding quarter.
4) Extract the downloaded Archive
5) Move the extracted files into the exports folder within DiscordChatExporter-frontend
6) Double-click to open dcef.exe
7) Wait. A command prompt will pop up and scroll past a bunch of text as it loads all of the archived messages.
8) Once all archived messages are loaded, the Archive Viewer will open a Discord-like interface, and you can scan through the archived channels and messages to your heart's content. Features like Discord search should work as it does in actual Discord
